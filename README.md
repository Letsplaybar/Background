# Background
It is A BetterDiscord Plugin to change the Background with help from this Theme [NotAnotherAnimeTheme](https://github.com/WhatDaPuck/NotAnotherAnimeTheme)

You can remove this part as this sets the plugin:
```css
[class~=app] {
    background: url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WhatDaPuck/NotAnotherAnimeTheme/master/image/PTT4OKi.jpg) !important;
    background-size: cover !important;
}
```


Install:<br />
Put the js and json file in the plugins folder of Betterdiscord

To set how long an image should stay or remove / add images go to options / plugins / Background / settings. Here you have 3 forms to change the necessary settings.
